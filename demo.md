## Demo Walkthrough

### 1. Dashboard Overview

![Dashboard](dashboard_screenshot.png)

The dashboard provides a high-level overview of the system, including:
- Total number of users in the system
- Total number of tasks
- Number of allocated tasks
- Recent task allocations with confidence scores

### 2. User Management

![Users](users_screenshot.png)

The Users page allows you to:
- View existing users with their skills, preferences, and performance metrics
- Add new users with customized skill profiles
- See current availability status for each user

**Demo Action:** Click on a user card to expand it and view detailed information about their skills and preferences.

### 3. Task Management

![Tasks](tasks_screenshot.png)

The Tasks page allows you to:
- View existing tasks with their requirements and deadlines
- Add new tasks with specific skill requirements
- See allocation status for each task

**Demo Action:** Add a new task by filling out the form at the bottom of the page with a title, description, required skills, priority, deadline, and estimated duration.

### 4. Availability Management

![Availability](availability_screenshot.png)

The Availability page provides tools to:
- View user availability on a calendar heatmap
- Add single time slots or recurring schedules
- Find common availability across multiple users

**Demo Action:** Select a user from the dropdown, then add a recurring availability slot for weekdays from 9 AM to 5 PM.

### 5. Task Allocation

![Task Allocation](allocation_screenshot.png)

The Task Allocation page demonstrates the core AI functionality:
- Select an unallocated task
- Let the AI match it to the most suitable user
- View detailed explanation for the match
- See skill comparison between user and task requirements
- View alternative matches with their confidence scores

**Demo Action:** Select an unallocated task and click "Match Task to Users" to see the AI in action.

## Key Features Demonstration

### Skill Matching

The system intelligently matches tasks to users based on skill requirements:

1. Select a task with specific skill requirements (e.g., "Design user dashboard" requiring React and JavaScript skills)
2. Click "Match Task to Users"
3. Observe how the system prioritizes users with matching skills
4. View the skill comparison radar chart showing how user skills align with task requirements

### Availability Awareness

The system considers user availability when making allocations:

1. Navigate to the Availability page
2. Mark a user as unavailable during a specific time period
3. Create a task with a deadline during that period
4. Observe how the system avoids allocating the task to the unavailable user

### Personalization

The system learns from past allocations to improve future matches:

1. Allocate several tasks to different users
2. Navigate to the Task Allocation page
3. For each allocation, observe the "Predicted user satisfaction" score in the allocation reason
4. Note how the system considers historical preferences and performance

## Demo Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New Project Kickoff

Demonstrate how to:
1. Add multiple team members with different skill sets
2. Create several project tasks with various requirements
3. Use the AI to optimally allocate initial project tasks
4. View the resulting allocations and explanations

### Scenario 2: Handling Team Member Absence

Demonstrate how to:
1. Mark a team member as out of office for a period
2. Reallocate their tasks to other team members
3. Observe how the system redistributes work based on skills and availability

### Scenario 3: Optimizing for Preferences

Demonstrate how to:
1. Set specific preferences for team members
2. Create tasks that align with those preferences
3. Observe how the system considers preferences in its allocations
4. View the personalized recommendations for each user

## Technical Highlights

During the demo, highlight these technical aspects:

1. **LangChain Integration**: How the system uses LangChain for intelligent task matching
2. **Machine Learning Model**: How the personalization engine learns from past allocations
3. **Real-time Availability**: How the system tracks and updates user availability
4. **Confidence Scoring**: How the system quantifies the quality of each match

## Conclusion

The AI Task Allocation Agent demonstrates how artificial intelligence can be used to optimize task allocation in teams, leading to:
- Better utilization of team skills
- Improved team member satisfaction
- More efficient project execution
- Reduced management overhead

The system is highly customizable and can be adapted to different team structures and project requirements.
